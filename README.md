This was the fifth task of my internship, where I learned how to host a static website using GitHub Pages. I created a repository with the format <username>.github.io, pushed my HTML, CSS, and JS files, and enabled GitHub Pages from the repository settings. After a few minutes, my site was live at https://prathamsingh.github.io. This task helped me understand how version control and static site deployment work together, and gave me a simple way to share my projects online.
